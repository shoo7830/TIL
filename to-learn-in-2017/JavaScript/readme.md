## React
1. React takes inputs to components as props and conditionally renders DOM updates if data has changed for specific parts of the DOM. Data updates during this phase can’t retrigger the render until the next drawing phase.
2. Event handling phase — after the DOM has rendered, React listens for and events, delegating events to a single event listener at the root of its DOM tree (for better performance). You can listen to those events and update data in response.
3. Using any changes to the data, the process repeats at 1.
