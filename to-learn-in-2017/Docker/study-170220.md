## Registry

* in ubuntu
  * install cert
  ~~~
  sudo cp foo.crt /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/foo.crt
  ~~~
  
  * update cert
  ~~~
  sudo update-ca-certificates
  ~~~
  
  * why?
  ~~~
  root@modu-todo:~# docker tag shoo-centos:0.1 docker.gabia.com/shoo-centos:0.1
  Error response from daemon: no such id: shoo-centos:0.1
  ~~~
  
* in windows, in mac
  * Add docker.gabia.com:443 in insecure registries
  * If the terminal is open, you need to run it and restart it.
